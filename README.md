# 3D-Sphere
Sphere Animation made in Three.js

## Some of my favorite settings:

let distance = 3;
let backgroundColor = "black";
let shapeColor = "aqua";
let xSpeed = 1;
let ySpeed = 1;
let xResolution = 30;
let yResolution = 20;
let thickness = 1;

let distance = 5;
let backgroundColor = "black";
let shapeColor = "green";
let xSpeed = 0;
let ySpeed = 2;
let xResolution = 30;
let yResolution = 30;
let thickness = 3;

let distance = 4;
let backgroundColor = "white";
let shapeColor = "black";
let xSpeed = 2;
let ySpeed = 3;
let xResolution = 50;
let yResolution = 1;
let thickness = 2;

let distance = 4;
let backgroundColor = "grey";
let shapeColor = "black";
let xSpeed = 2;
let ySpeed = 3;
let xResolution = 100;
let yResolution = 3;
let thickness = 2;

let distance = 4;
let backgroundColor = "black";
let shapeColor = "red";
let xSpeed = 1;
let ySpeed = 1;
let xResolution = 3;
let yResolution = 50;
let thickness = 1;

let distance = 1;
let backgroundColor = "beige";
let shapeColor = "gold";
let xSpeed = 50;
let ySpeed = 0;
let xResolution = 200;
let yResolution = 10;
let thickness = 1;
